# message-Encryption-Decryption
A simple cryptography technique to encrypt & decrypt a message .
Language use: python , in which I have used tkinter package to create GUI.
Encryption technique used: Vigenere Cipher.

E(P)= (P + k)mod26 , D(E)=(P-K)mod26
..................................
future view: I will improve and I will try to used a hard algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the message.
